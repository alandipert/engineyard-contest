Building on Linux:

Building on OS X:

    make osx

Strategy:

This just tries combinations of 12 words from words.txt, and tests the Hamming distance to see if it's the lowest so far.
It doesn't append the 5 random characters and it doesn't mess with case.

Checking:

    make check

./check "some string" will print out the challenge hash, the hash of arg[1], and the Hamming distance.  You can use this
to double check results.
